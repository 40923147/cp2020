These drives contain capacity speeds comparable to their larger counterparts. Smaller notebooks might use an even smaller variant that is only 1.8 inches in diameter. These drives often operate at similar speeds to their larger counterparts, but may lack the same capacity for storage. These HDDs make use of a spinning disk with magnetic storage design. \n Current laptops, especially netbooks and other laptops that require thinner, lighter, and faster storage options, use solid-state disks (SSDs) following the 2.5, 1.8, or mSata form factor. Initially, manufacturers developed a hybrid disk combining an internal disk with a form of flash storage used to speed up access times. These were faster than traditional HDDs and much less expensive than a full SSD at the time. \n SSDs contain no actual disk or moving parts. They are highly resistant to shock and movement, and have low latency and high access speeds. The performance of SSDs is far superior to traditional spinning hard disk drives, and they use less power than traditional hard disks, as well, which makes them ideal for mobile applications such as laptops and notebooks. HDD manufacturers have improved the design of SSDs, making them more resilient to I/O writes and reads and less susceptible to the failure first generation SSDs could suffer from if not configured correctly. \n In addition to traditional SATA or mSATA SSDs, many laptop manufacturers have chosen to incorporate embedded multi-media cards (eMMCs) in smaller 2-in-1 laptops, Chromebooks, or tablets that are designed with a detachable keyboard. eMMCs have faster access times than traditional HDDs, but are slower than an SSD. As the name implies, this storage device is an integrated circuit (IC) chip located on the motherboard. Currently, eMMCs most often come in either 16 GB, 32 GB or 64 GB capacity. Manufacturers most often include a micro secure digital (MicroSD) card reader and USB port to allow for external storage. \n Laptop hard drives and SSDs are generally upgradable and replaceable, but the “internal storage” label for eMMC is not. \n With HDDs and SSDs being standard form factors (2.5-inch or 1.8-inch varieties), they can easily be removed and replaced with a larger capacity or higher speed version as long as the new drive matches in physical size and connection type (SATA or mSATA). To replace a hard drive, the technician simply removes the drive in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. It is always important to check with the laptop manufacturer’s instructions on the best way to remove the drive. Some models have a direct access area from the bottom of the laptop, while others require full disassembly of the machine, including the keyboard and casing. \n \n \n Laptop hard drives.

In desktops, DDR, DDR2, and DDR3 RAM modules are used to upgrade our systems, based upon the memory slots provided by the motherboard, and the speed and size accepted by the motherboard. Laptops, similarly, require the proper size and speed modules for their motherboards. Therefore, it is important to check the manufacturer’s manual for a laptop. Laptop memory also comes in DDR, DDR2, and DDR3 varieties, but laptops use the SODIMM (small outline dual in-line memory module) form factor. These are much smaller, more compact versions of the standard DDR, DDR2, and DDR3 modules, but they operate at the same speed and capacity as the larger versions. \n \n SODIMM in a laptop. Photo used under CC-BY-NC license from \xa0 Ben Williams . \n Replacing and upgrading memory is a fairly simply process, similar to replacing memory in a desktop machine. First, remove the power by shutting down the laptop, removing the power cord, and (if possible) removing the battery from the laptop. Next, replace the existing memory module, or add a second one, if applicable. Some laptops, like the one shown above, have a small plastic door covering the memory slots for easy access. Others may require full disassembly to access the memory slots. In a desktop computer, the modules are inserted at a straight-up-and-down vertical angle (90 degrees), but with laptops, the modules are inserted at a 45-degree angle first. Then the modules are pushed down into place once they are fully inserted into the memory slot. This is required due to the space limitations in the laptop. \n Some laptops have a single memory slot, while others have two slots. Some laptops may have their memory soldered onto the motherboard, making upgrading or removing the memory impossible. Always check your laptop’s manual for details on how many modules your laptop will accept (if any), how many gigabytes they can be, and the speed of the modules. For example, in the bottom image below, we see a 2 GB DDR2 memory module that operates at 6400 MBps, or 800 MHz. \n \n 2 GB DDR2 memory module.

Usually, this occurs when something jars the laptop while the hard disk is working. Another cause of hard drive failure is an overheated hard drive. The hard drive, like other devices in the computer, requires adequate cooling to ensure proper operation. If the hard drive overheats, you need to check to see if the laptop is receiving adequate cooling. You can do this by making sure the air intake and fans are working properly and are not filled with dust. \n Mechanical failures and defects are another possible cause of hard drive failure in laptops and notebooks. Bad sectors in the hard disk, the motor’s failure to perform rotation, power supply issues, and many other issues can cause hard drive failures. An old hard disk may create problems, or mechanical failure can occur if you have formatted the hard disk too many times. Normally, you can hear a mechanical failure — there may be a clicking sound coming from the disk, or you will hear the disk fail to “spin up” when powered on. \n Other issues with hard drives include data becoming corrupted or invalid due to virus infection or attacks, abnormal system shutdown, accidental cancellation of a running program, frequent power failure, and many other causes. These are not issues solely in laptops; these problems can occur with both laptop and desktop models. \n To determine if a laptop hard drive has failed, you must follow a logical troubleshooting methodology. First, attempt to boot up the computer. If you cannot see the display working, then listen for the hard disk. Did you hear it “spin up” when you powered on the machine? If not, it is likely a laptop power issue and not a hard drive issue. Check the battery and the AC adapter to ensure the laptop is receiving power. \n If the laptop display did turn on, then you need to see if the operating system boots. If it does not boot, it could be a data corruption issue or a hard drive failure. First, try booting the laptop from the AC adapter instead of the battery. Did that work? If so, it may be that the battery isn’t providing enough power to spin the hard drive properly. If that does not work, next, check the BIOS to see if the hard drive is being recognized. If the drive is not recognized in the BIOS, check the physical connections (power and data cables, like IDE/PATA and SATA). If the hard drive is recognized in the BIOS, but the operating system does not boot, it could be that the data on the drive has become corrupted; therefore, the operating system may need to be reinstalled and the user data may need to be restored from backup. \n If the drive isn’t recognized by the BIOS or loading the operating system, you may have a hard drive failure. Listen to the hard drive; do you hear a mechanical clicking sound? If you do, your hard drive is likely failing and should be replaced as soon as possible. If you do not hear any clicking noises, there might be bad sectors on the disk, so perform disk maintenance procedures, such as “check disk” (CHKDSK) or “disk defragmentation” (DISK DEFRAG). \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Troubleshooting Hard Drives\xa0 127.html'}, {'title': 'PCH 19', 'text': 'PCH 19 Notebook Power and Physical Security \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH 19.html'}, {'title': 'Overview 129', 'text': '\n In this module on notebooks, we will discuss the various types of batteries used in notebook and laptop computers, along with battery construction, battery care, and various power level indicators. We will also discuss the variety of power sources a notebook has access to, including its battery, AC adapter, and docking stations. Next, we will discuss the proper disposal procedures that should be used when someone upgrades or breaks their notebook. Finally, we will discuss the physical security of notebooks. We will look at the construction of these devices, as well as the proper installation of the security cable and how it is connected to the notebook. \n \n \n \n \n Battery Types \n Laptops and notebooks can receive power from several different types of batteries. The batteries are used to provide direct current (DC) to your notebook, and the batteries are then recharged by the alternating current (AC) adapter that connects your notebook to the wall outlet. The AC adapter actually works as a transformer, converting the wall outlet’s high-voltage AC into low-voltage DC that your notebook uses to charge its battery. \n \n Battery cells. Photo used under CC-BY-SA license from \xa0 Uwe Hermann . \n The notebook battery is an enclosed plastic casing with individual battery cells on the inside, as shown in the images above. Older notebooks used either nickel-cadmium (NiCd or NiCad) or nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries. These types of batteries are seldom used in modern notebooks and laptops because they suffered from what is termed the “memory effect.” Basically, the “memory effect” occurs when a battery loses its capacity to fully recharge if it is discharged repeatedly the same amount and then recharged without being fully drained first. For example, if every time your notebook battery’s charge was at 20 percent you went and recharged it, then 20 percent charge would become the new zero for your battery, reducing the overall charge available to only 80 percent of the original capacity. \n Both of these battery types were replaced with lithium-ion batteries. The lithium-ion batteries do not suffer from the memory effect issue. They perform better than other types of batteries, and are lighter in weight, which increases a notebook’s mobility. Lithium-ion batteries also feature a rapid-charging option that allows faster charging when the user is in a hurry. These batteries are more environmentally friendly than the previous types, as well. \n To best care for your notebook or laptop, always use the approved battery type for your model. Using unapproved batteries in your notebook can lead to the notebook catching fire or exploding. In order to maintain notebook batteries at peak operating efficiency, keep the batteries at room temperature and avoid heat. If your notebook has a full charge and is subjected to high temperatures, the longevity of your battery will decrease. Batteries deteriorate over time, so purchase one with the most recent manufacturing date for the longest life. Also, getting a higher-capacity battery will provide a longer battery life on a given charge. Since lithium-ion batteries do not have a memory effect, it is often better to use partial-discharge cycles for notebooks and laptops that use those batteries. Note, while there is no memory effect, some lithium-ion batteries suffer from a “digital memory” that decreases the accuracy of the power gauge. To recalibrate the power gauge, you need to fully discharge the battery routinely, such as every few months, then completely recharge it. Lastly, if you are planning on storing your notebook for a while, it is best to discharge the battery to about 50 percent first, then store it in a cool, dry place. This will prolong the life of the battery and prevent you from having to waste money on a replacement. \n The amount of battery life is indicated in a number of ways in a notebook, depending on the computer model. All modern operating systems provide a digital gauge inside the operating system. This indication can be set by the user to show either the percentage of battery life remaining (such as 53 percent left), the time remaining until the battery runs out (such as 1 hour, 43 minutes to empty), or the time to full charge (such as 34 minutes to full charge). Some models of batteries, though, have a battery gauge included on the battery itself. This will use a scale, such as five circles that will light up to show the remaining life of the battery. \n \n Laptop battery.

While the battery directly powers the notebook’s components, much like a power supply in a desktop, the battery doesn’t perform any transformation of the power it receives or sends out. These functions are handled by the AC adapter. Many docking stations provide the ability to either use the regular AC adapter as their power source, or use a built-in AC adapter to perform the transformation of the power from AC to DC. If the laptop is using a docking station, it still uses the battery to provide power to the laptop, and the docking station to charge the laptop’s battery. A \xa0 port replicator \xa0 , on the other hand, requires the AC adapter to perform the transformation for it. \n \n Docking station rear view. Photo used under CC-BY license from \xa0 Tolbxela . \n Docking stations are used to add capabilities to a laptop and create a "desktop" experience. For example, in the image above, you can see that the docking station has numerous USB ports, a PS/2 port for keyboard/mouse, a modem port, Ethernet port, VGA and DVI display outputs, audio input and output ports, as well as serial and parallel connections. Some docking stations even have built-in hard drives and optical drives for additional storage. A port replicator, on the other hand, only provides the same ports that already exist on the laptop. This is used for quick connection and disconnection to the various external devices when the laptop is returned to the office environment. \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'AC Power\xa0 130.html'}, {'title': 'Proper Disposal Procedures 131', 'text': '\n Rechargeable laptop batteries contain hazardous materials such as mercury, cadmium, and lead. Many states have laws governing the disposal of batteries containing toxic materials. Often disposing of them in the trash and sending them to a landfill is illegal. Recycling, sometimes referred to as eCycling in the case of computers and other electronics, reduces the amount of toxic elements entering the waste stream and is often the required or preferred disposal method. Recycling saves landfill space, conserves our natural resources, and reduces the amount of electronic waste generated by residents in the state. For example, according to the State of Maryland, eCycling reduces more than 150,000 tons of waste every year. Local regulations (state, county, or city) dictate the proper methods of disposing of the physical laptop and its components. \n \n If, instead of disposing of the entire laptop, you wish to sell the device, you should first remove your personal information from the laptop. The best way to do this is to perform a hard drive format using overwrite software. This is also known as a “secure erase,” where every portion of the hard disk is rewritten with a “0” in order to fully clear your personal data from the device. Then, if necessary, you can reinstall the operating system and sell the device. \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Proper Disposal Procedures 131.html'}, {'title': 'Security\xa0 132', 'text': 'Security cables are used to ensure that laptops are not physically removed from a particular area. Security cables are constructed much like a bicycle security lock, with a thick, carbon strengthened steel or metal cable that has a loop on one end and a lock on the other. The lock end has a T-shaped head that is inserted into the Kensington security slot on the computer (named after the first company to produce these locks). The locks are set using either a key or a combination-style lock. The other end, with the loop, can then be secured to a stationary device, like a pole or the desk itself. Often, these are installed by looping the lock end through the loop end, as it goes around a portion of the desk, securing the security lock to a location on the desk. Some security cables also have an audible alarm feature that alerts when someone tries to force the lock. Remember that these physical security measures only work when used properly.
